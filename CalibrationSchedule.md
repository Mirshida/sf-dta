# June #
## Week of June 4 ##
  * Runs with signals+transit+generalized cost
  * Run 1: Transit (minus lrt); most signals; travel time, not generalized cost. Good convergence. Some gridlock caused by signal errors.
  * Run 2: Transit+LRT; more signals; generalized cost from previous calibration.
  * Renee - Resolve remaining signal imports/issues.
> > - Unsignalized intersections
  * Michalis - Initial reporting of validation statistics.

## Week of June 11 ##
  * Traffic flow model data collection
  * target 3-5 runs!
  * Renee - Investigate and resolve specific gridlocks.
  * Michalis - Evaluate validation reports.  Recommend further reporting or specific mitigation strategies.
  * Greg - Outline of feedback options.
  * PB - Set up model to run in NY.  Review & QC of open issues.

## Week of June 18 ##
  * Implement traffic flow model
  * target 3-5 runs!
  * Renee - Select link traces of specific problem areas.  Identify network, routing, or demand issues as a result.
  * Michalis - Recommend & implement specific changes in traffic flow parameters or generalized cost function based on evaluation of validation reports.
  * Greg - Distribute feedback options outline for input from others.

## Week of June 25 ##
  * We move! / Don't expect to get runs done on our machines!!!
  * target 3-5 runs in NY.
  * Michalis - Evaluate boundary conditions at external stations.  Evaluate diurnal profiles.
  * Renee - Investigate additional problem areas.  Identify (but not necessarily resolve) demand issues.
  * Greg - Edit & improve feedback options memo.
