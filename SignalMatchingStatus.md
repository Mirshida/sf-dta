# Signal Card Matching Progress #

Of 1,147 signal cards describing San Francisco traffic signal timing, 23 signal cards have not been programmatically matched with network nodes.  These remaining signals cards probably need to be coded into the Dynameq network manually.  A list of unmatchable signal cards and the reason for matching failure is shown below.  In addition to the unmatched signal cards an additional 41 are being ignored because they represent signals that are not expected to have an impact on traffic operations or capacity (e.g. mid-block pedestrian crossings, flashing yellow lights near schools, etc.)
