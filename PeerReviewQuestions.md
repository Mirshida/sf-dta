# Calibration Strategies #

## General Strategies ##
  1. Are the strategies that we've already employed appropriate?
  1. Are there any tricks or strategies that we should be trying that we haven't yet?
  1. How should we prioritize our effort for calibration moving forward?

## Traffic Flow Parameters ##
  1. Does our data collection methodology and associated results make sense?
  1. Are there other observed data that we should be trying to collect?

## Model Formulation ##
  1. We have a generalized cost function that we've basically inferred, but how do we get a better one both now, and after we get observed routes from 2012 California Household Travel Survey
  1. Do the DTA settings that we have chosen make sense?
  1. How sensitive should the model be to these settings?
  1. What others should we test out and why?

## Validation Targets ##
  1. Are there any validation standards for a large-scale DTA? When is ‘enough’?
  1. How should we measure the "stability" of the results? What should we be looking at other than relative gap?
  1. Similarly, how should we test the model's sensitivity to changes in: network geometry; signal operations; other?
  1. How does one validate to conflicting data?

## Network Coding ##
  1. Is there a way to deal with movement-specific yellow time in signal phases where there is another movement that has continuing green time?
  1. Transit lanes that allow specific movements in them (i.e. right turns)

# Integration Strategies #
  1. How should we prioritize the strategies listed in the integration memo both for "Demand Information for DTA" and "DTA Information for Demand"
  1. What thoughts or cautions would you give to simultaniously pursuing person-based dynamic transit assignment a la FastTrips?

# Technology Transfer #
  1. What (if anything) about this process/project would be useful for other agencies to learn and hear about? In what format?
  1. What parts of the code base that we have developed (if any) would be useful to operationalize for others?

# Research #
  1. Are there any research or application questions that it seems like we should be able to answer with this project?
