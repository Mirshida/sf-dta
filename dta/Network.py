class Network:
    """
    Base class that represents a DTA Network.  Networks exist on a continuum between
    macro- and micro-simulation, and this network is meant to represent something
    "typical" for a mesosimulation.  Something to be aware of in case it becomes too complicated.
    
    Subclasses will be used to represent networks for different frameworks (Dynameq, Cube, etc)
    so this class should have no code to deal with any particular file formats.
