# Why Have a Peer Review? #

Developing a citywide Dynamic Traffic Assignment model with detail on every street in the city is not a common task in this country much less the world.  There are no guidebooks and few examples to learn from.  This void is one reason we are trying to develop everything "in the open" including this webpage.  To make our DTA project as successful as possible, we assembled a panel of experts to help us answer [specific questions](http://code.google.com/p/dta/wiki/PeerReviewQuestions) we have come up with along the way, assess "how we are doing", and provide strategic guidance.

# Background Documents #

The following documents should be reviewed by panel meeting participants prior to the meeting.  Some documentation pieces are in the form of an interactive website while others in a _working paper_ format.  The working papers will be finalized at a later point in the project based on the feedback from the panel and the progress of the project.

The documentation is organized here to address specific question of various aspects of the project:

  1. **What is the motivation of this project?**
    * 1-a [Research Problem Statement](http://code.google.com/p/dta/wiki/ResearchProblemStatement)
    * 1-b Planning, Policy, and Analysis questions that we are looking to DTA to answer
  1. **How does a DTA model fit into the current overall context of travel analysis at SFCTA?** [Overview of DTA at SFCTA](http://www.sfcta.org/dta)
  1. **What does the DTA Anyway codebase do?** [Overview documentation for the DTA Anyway Codebase](http://dta.googlecode.com/git-history/dev/doc/_build/html/index.html)
  1. **How was the SF Citywide DTA Model Calibrated? How well does it validate?** [Working Draft Calibration Report](http://dta.googlecode.com/files/SF%20DTA%20Model%20Calibration%20and%20Validation%20WorkingDraftToPeerReviewPanel.pdf)
  1. **What are the plans for integrating DTA with the SF-CHAMP Activity-Based Travel Demand Model?** [Integration Paper](http://dta.googlecode.com/files/SF%20DTA%20Model%20Integration%20Options%20Jul-13_FinalWorkingDraftForPeerReviewPanel.pdf)
